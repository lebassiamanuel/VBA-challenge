# VBA-challenge
# Data

This assignement involved creating a VBA script to loop through stock data and deliver a summary per "Ticker".

In the summary table I had to deliver each individual "Ticker" along with:

The yearly change (difference between year closing price and opening price)
Percent Change (Perecent difference between the year closing and opening price)
Total Stock Volume (Accumulation of the volume of stock across a year for each ticker)
Once the summary table had been populated, I then had to find some additonal statistics:

Greatest % Increase (Which ticker experienced the greatest % increase)
Greatest % Decrease (Which ticker experienced the greatest % decrease)
Greatest Total Volume (Which ticker has the greatest total volume)

# Formatting
For ease of viewing; formatting was applied to the Yearly Change and Percent Change columns:

Positive change cells coloured Green
Negative change cells coloured Red
And number formatting applied:

Yearly change formatted as a currency in USD ($)
Percent change formatted as perecentage to 2 decimal places (0.00%)
I also researched and added some additonal formatting to a range of cells:

Headers for the Summary table Bold and Horizontal Central Alignment
Headers for the Summary table also contained the year which was retrieved from the sheet name
Headers for the Greatest % Increase/Decrease and Total Volume Bold and Horiztonal Central Alignment
Total Stock Volume formatted as comma seperated to 0 decimal places
